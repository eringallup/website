      <p>They’re people working in tech and in finance. Some of them mined bitcoins the currency’s infancy and watched their worth skyrocket. They are interested in strengthening the currency and see it as an investment vehicle. For security they often have their bitcoins spread across many different companies and need to see an aggregated view of their worth.</p>
      <p>The structure of the currency is such that there are often multiple companies holding user’s bitcoins. There is also a great deal of volatility with the currency so being able to track its trading price is important.</p>

      <p>To soften the outreach process for both the job seeker and the recruiter, simplicity and privacy had to be designed into the product. The app would allow a candidate to share their linked in profile page to be automatically qualified. They would browse through jobs with direct, easy to read details and show interest by clicking the checkmark button. They would be contacted only through text and only if they first showed interest.</p>

      <p>The recruiter would have a streamlined process of adding jobs to the system through an easy to use website that guides them into creating an appealing posting with succinct details. They would no longer need to contact potential candidates out of the blue as the system would show only people with real interest.</p>
