      <p>Web publishers are blogs, news and product websites whose revenue comes from running ads. Their day to day focus is on providing fresh engaging content and increasing their readership. They make money by selling advertising space either directly to an advertiser, through partnering with ad networks or programatically through ad exchanges. </p>

    <div class="body-right col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-1">
      <p>Quantcast is a company that provides free analytics to web publishers. Similar to Google Analytics, a publisher inserts code onto their web pages that allows visits to be tracked. They are then provided with analytic reports of demographic and psychographic data which are used to describe their audience to potential partners or advertisers.</p>
      <p>I worked at Quantcast for nearly two years, getting to know web publishers and redesigning Quantcast's measure product to best suit their needs.</p>

    <div class="body-right col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-1">
      <p>Web publishers reported that the design of Quantcast's product was complicated looking. They felt lost in many layers of navigation and felt like they couldn't find their favorite features without having to click several times. They wanted an easier way to use the data provided to back up their story to advertisers and set themselves up for new opportunities.</p>

    <div class="body-right col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-1">
      <p>At first it was was unclear how publishers were using Quantcast's product. I partnered with a user researcher and performed in depth interviews with over a dozen publishers using the measure product. We learned that they were most interested in embedding Quantcast charts in reports to advertisers, comparing themselves to their competition, and having a public profile that opens themselves up to new opportunities.</p>


      <p>I started by simplifying the navigation and created a wrapper that would ease Quantcast into the redesign. I created a home page that was direct and easy to read. After this launched we began the product redesign process.</p>
      <img class="responsive" style="margin:20px 0 60px 0; border: 1px solid #cfcfcf;" src="../images/quantcast/1.png">

      <p>I redesigned the measure tool to give the publishers quick and easy access to their metrics and an ability to control the presentation of their data in their profile so they could show themselves in the best possible light.</p>
      <img class="responsive" style="margin:20px 0 60px 0; border: 1px solid #cfcfcf;" src="../images/quantcast/12.png">

      <p>Because comparisons were important, I designed an area where publishers could save favorites, categorize them and create comparison charts.</p>
      <img class="responsive" style="margin:20px 0 60px 0; border: 1px solid #cfcfcf;" src="../images/quantcast/10.png">

      <p>Each data visualization was customized for clarity and purpose.</p>
