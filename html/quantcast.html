      <p>Web publishers are blogs, news and product websites that make their revenue from running ads. Their day to day focus is on providing fresh engaging content and increasing their readership. </p>
      <p>Because their money is made from ads, they must provide accurate, impartial metrics of their readership to ad serving companies (ad networks) and prove they are a fit. </p>

    <div class="body-right col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-1">
      <p>Quantcast is a company that provides free analytics to web publishers. Similar to Google Analytics, a publisher inserts code onto their web pages that allows visits to be tracked. They are then provided with analytic reports which are used as proof in reports to ad networks.</p>
      <p>I worked at Quantcast for nearly two years, getting to know web publishers and redesigning Quantcast's analytic product to best suit their needs.</p>

    </div>
    <div class="body-right col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-1">
      <p>The design before I came to Quantcast was years old and cobbled together. The site had a large unwieldy navigation that changed from page to page and required a lot of reading. The home page had a lot of reading as well and included buzzy words that were hard to understand. The product had a cluttered feel with lots of outlines and tiny text. The entire site required the user to do a lot of reading.</p>
      <p>Beyond the design, there was a lack of understanding of who the product served and how it was being used.</p>
      <p>Because the site was created over the course of years, it contained a great deal of legacy code that made small changes very difficult. A sweeping site design could not happen without massive interruptions.</p>

      </div>
    </div>
    <div class="body-right col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-1">
      <p>To ease the product into a redesign, I started by simplifying the navigation and created a wrapper to replace the dated menus. I replaced the wordy home page with one that was direct and easy to read. After this launched we began the product redesign process.</p>
      <p>It was imperative to truly understand who was using the site and how it was being used. I partnered with a user researcher to tackle this and we did in depth interviews with dozens of the top publishers using Quantcast's product. It was through these interviews that we learned that publishers were most interested in using the site for metrics to give to their ad networks, to compare themselves to other sites like them, and to promote themselves to lead to new opportunities.</p>
      <p>With this information, I redesigned the measure tool to give the publishers easy access to their metrics, to save profiles to compare to their own and to make their own profile show their data in the best possible light.</p>
