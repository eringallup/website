            <p>This project was a sketch to test the concept of a &lsquo;Tinder for jobs&rsquo;. The first task was to decide on a name and pull together a logo.</p>

      <p>The passive job seeker is a skilled employee who is starting to feel that the next job is on the horizon. They are busy with their current job and do not have time to do a search, but would be open to new opportunities. They only want to see jobs that they are qualified for and ones that they'd leave their current job for. They are frequently contacted by recruiters - many times at inopportune times and for jobs they are not interested in. </p>

      <p>To soften the outreach process for both the job seeker and the recruiter, simplicity and privacy had to be designed into the product. The app would automatically qualify a candidate by parsing their Linkedin profile. A seeker could browse through jobs with direct, easy to read details and show interest by clicking the checkmark button. They would be contacted only through text and only if they showed interest first .</p>
      <img class="responsive phone" src="../images/rarelead/screens/4.png">


      <p>The recruiter would have a streamlined process of adding jobs to the system through a website that guides them into creating an appealing posting with succinct details. </p>
      <img class="responsive" src="../images/rarelead/8-1.png">

      <p>They would no longer need to contact potential candidates out of the blue as the system would show only people with real interest.</p>

      <p>The landing page was designed to gauge job seeker interest while we tested out the concept.</p>
