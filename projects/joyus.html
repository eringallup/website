      <p>Joyus' old logo and branding were targeted towards older women, which limited its customer base. The site took several clicks for viewers to access video pages and the traditional ecommerce navigation required a lot of reading and comprehension.<!--It's demographic was women aged 30-60, but its transition to a channel on a platform required a new design.The new hub had to have a clean, simple design that appealed to many different customer types and allowed shoppers to browse and buy easily.--></p>

    <div class="body-right col-sm-7 col-sm-offset-1">
      <p>The first task was to update the Joyus logo to a neutral gold tone, which elevated the brand and allowed for an immediate update for the site transition. Other brand refreshes included updated typographic system and updated color palette, which were implemented across the site and all videos.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive" style="border:none" src="../images/joyus/1.png">
      <p>Next, the product detail page design was updated to make viewing and shopping easier.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive" src="../images/joyus/2.png">
       <p>An identity for the new umbrella site, Tique (a shortening of 'boutique') was created to be harmonious with the new Joyus brand yet be neutral so it could work for many different future channels. The logo was a subtle reference to a replay button.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive" style="border:none" src="../images/joyus/3.png">
      <p>The design for the Tique hub allowed for products to be grouped by thematic channels and their videos watched uninterrupted, without a page refresh.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive"  src="../images/joyus/4.png">
      <p>The Tique channels page allowed for products to be grouped into infinite categories.</p>

      <p>The future Joyus channel.</p>

      <img class="img-responsive"  src="../images/joyus/9.png">
      <p>The product detail page used in Joyus' transition would be seemlessly integrated into the Tique website.</p>
      <img class="img-responsive"  src="../images/joyus/10.png">
      <p>The shoppable player embedded into publisher websites like Aol stands out yet complements many sites.</p>
